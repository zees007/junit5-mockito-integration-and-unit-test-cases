You can follow my blogs for a step-by-step guide on Integration & Unit Testing using JUnit 5, Mockito, and achieving code coverage with JaCoCo.

This article is quite detailed and lengthy as it covers integration test cases for JWT-authenticated endpoints at the controller level and unit test cases at the service level using JUnit 5 and the Mockito framework. Therefore, I have divided the article into two parts:

<h1>ðŸ‘‰ Part 1: Integration Test Cases at the Controller Level</h1>
